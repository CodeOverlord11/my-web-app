    <h3>What is Devops?</h3>
    <p>DevOps is a cultural, technical, and process-oriented methodology that merges software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to accelerate software delivery. By utilizing automation tools and improved collaboration, teams can continuously build, test, and deploy software faster and more reliably than traditional, siloed methods. </p>
    <p> key categories including Version Control (Git), CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab CI), Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible), Monitoring (Prometheus, Datadog), and Collaboration (Jira, Confluence), all working together in a toolchain to improve speed, quality, and collaboration between Dev and Ops teams.</p>
